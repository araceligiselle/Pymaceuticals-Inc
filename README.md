### Analysis

*Tumor Volume Reduction: The box plot analysis of the four treatment regimens (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin) shows that Capomulin and Ramicane are more effective in reducing tumor volume compared to Infubinol and Ceftamin. The median tumor volume of mice treated with Capomulin and Ramicane is significantly lower, indicating their potential efficacy in tumor suppression.

*Mouse Weight Correlation: There is a strong positive correlation (correlation coefficient â‰ˆ 0.84) between mouse weight and the average observed tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen. Heavier mice tend to have larger tumor volumes, indicating that the mouse's body weight may influence tumor growth.

*Potential Outliers: In the Infubinol treatment group, there is a potential outlier with a tumor volume of around 36.32 mm3. This outlier could indicate either an unusual response to the treatment or an error in the data collection. Further investigation and validation are required to determine the cause of this potential outlier.
